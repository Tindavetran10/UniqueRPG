  itemDescription: "Forged from the primordial frost of an eternal glacier in the
    Far North, Glaciluna is more than a weapon\u2014it is a remnant of a forgotten
    moon, entombed in ice and time. The faint blue glow etched along its dark blade
    is not reflected light, but the crystallized essence of moonlight itself, still
    breathing in the silence of the cold.\n\nWhen unsheathed, the air around Glaciluna
    stills, as if the world holds its breath. Each strike leaves behind a fleeting
    trail of shimmering frost, and for a brief moment, enemies glimpse their shadow
    dissolving beneath a phantom moon.\n\nLegends whisper: \u201COnly those who\u2019ve
    died beneath the moon can see its true light.\u201D\n\nGlaciluna does not choose
    a master\u2014it waits. For a soul born in solitude, one who walks through frost
    and shadow without fear."
